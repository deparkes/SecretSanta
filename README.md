SecretSanta
===========
It's a secret santa program in pythonso that you don't have to put up with mathworks' DRM shit. You need to change lines 10-14 to match your secret santa gmail account of choise but other than that it's all good to go out of the box. Enjoy it and if you want to complain do it to someone else.
